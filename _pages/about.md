The Evolutionary Anthropology Society is a section of the American Anthropological Association. We bring together those interested in applying modern evolutionary theory to the analysis of human biology, behavior, and culture. We welcome students, faculty, and anyone with similar interests to join the EAS and help us build a thriving community of researchers.

Our membership includes human behavioral ecologists, primatologists, archaeologist, cultural anthropologists, psychologists, biologists, and paleoanthropologists, to name a few. At the annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association (AAA), we provide venues for students, young investigators, and senior researchers to get to know each other and to present current research on a variety of topics within evolutionary anthropology.

Our emphasis is on scientific analyses including a balance of theory and data. Evolutionary anthropology is a broad and exciting field, and we encourage research and presentations on a wide range of topics.

Society presentations at AAA meetings involve research on foraging and food sharing in comparative and diachronic perspective, gender roles, evolutionary applied anthropology, the evolution of cooperation and inequality, and more.
