Secretary/Treasurer (2012-16); Siobhán Mattison, Contributing Editor (2012-16); Bria Dunham, Webmaster (2012-16); Carol Ember, Member-at-Large

Starkweather, Student Representative (2012-14). Brief introductions of newest members follow.

**Raymond Hames** is professor and chair of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Department of Anthropology. His research focuses on flows of goods and
services, kinship, offspring investment, and marriage among the Yanomamö and Ye’kwana of Venezuela. As President-Elect, Ray will increase our visibility by
reaching out to all scholars with interests in evolutionary anthropology, and enhance support of early-stage evolutionary anthropologists by expanding our
Internet presence and by using our column to disseminate items of particular interest to junior scholars.

**Dawn Neill** is Assistant Professor of Anthropology in the Social Sciences Department at California Polytechnic State University. She is a behavioral ecologist
with interests in medical and nutritional anthropology, parental investment, and obesity. She explores urbanization, migration, and parental investment among
Indo-Fijians. As Secretary and Treasurer, Dawn hopes to build institutional knowledge, increase accessibility of EAS-related information through the use of our
website and social media, and facilitate open communication between the Board and membership.

**Siobhán Mattison** is a lecturer in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Auckland. A behavioral ecologist working with the Mosuo of China,
her interests focus on kinship and social systems, demography and quantitative methods, and social inequality. As Contributing Editor, Siobhán hopes to attract
new members by expanding Internet public relations (e.g., Twitter and Facebook) and to improve support of junior members through her columns, which will
center around summaries of evolutionary anthropology programs and practical guides or “how-to”s for evolutionary anthropologists.

**Mary Shenk** is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of Missouri. Her research combines evolutionary, economic, and demographic approaches
to the study of marriage, parental investment, and fertility in the context of different socioeconomic and kinship systems in India and Bangladesh. As a member
of the Board, she hopes to increase EAS membership, encourage collaboration with other sections, advocate for the recognition of scientific approaches within
the AAA, and to support students by providing a venue for research presentations, job interviews, and mentoring.

**Brooke Scelza** is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at UCLA. A human behavioral ecologist whose research focuses on questions related to reproductive
decision-making and parental investment, she studies how social environments influence life history trade-offs, extra-pair paternity, and women’s mobility
among the Himba of Namibia. As a member of the Board, Brooke will work toward increasing membership, particularly among our junior scholars, whose
active engagement with EAS is critical to our future as an organization.

**Shane MacFarlan** is an instructor of anthropology at Oregon State University studying the relationships between social cohesion, status, and cooperative
action in rural Latin America and the Caribbean. He has been a member of EAS since 2005. Since this time, the EAS has contributed to his professional
development, as one of the few venues where graduate students and academic scientists can showcase research in evolutionary anthropology. As a member of the
Board, Shane hopes to increase membership, contribute to professional development, advocate for science in anthropology, and foster intellectual exchange
between researchers from all anthropological disciplines.

**Katie Starkweather** is a PhD student at the University of Missouri studying marriage, polyandry, and parental investment in small-scale societies in conjunction with dissertation work among the Shodhagor of Bangladesh. As Student Representative, Katie plans to increase student membership and
involvement using social media outlets.

**Bria Dunham** studies romantic and parental decision-making and is currently Adjunct Assistant Professor at Columbia University and an MPH candidate at
New York University. As Webmaster, Bria will work to make the EAS website a useful tool for engagement with our membership.
