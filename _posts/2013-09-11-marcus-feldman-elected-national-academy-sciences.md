Among the 84 scholars elected to the National Academy of Sciences this year was evolutionary biologist Marcus
Feldman. Feldman has built a luminous legacy in biology, however his contributions to evolutionary
anthropology and the anthropological sciences are also wide-ranging and significant. These include building
formal models of cultural evolution and the interaction of culture, genetics and the built-environment, applying
cultural-evolutionary models to demographic issues in China, and using human genetics to challenge racist
theories of intelligence.

Put concisely by his Stanford colleague and EAS member James
Holland Jones, Feldman’s “scientific contributions are
enormous.” Jones notes, “he has published nearly 500 papers in
his career and the remarkable thing about this is that each one
contains a new idea.” Jones attributes much of this dynamism to
Feldman’s extensive collaborations, notably with his students,
post-docs, and other junior scholars. Siobhán Mattison (U
Auckland), a former post-doc and a contributing editor to this
column says Feldman’s “most inspiring characteristic as a
mentor is the way he marries scholarship and advocacy without
sacrificing scientific objectivity...His recent receipt of a $1
million Dan David prize award is a further testament to this
quality.”

Feldman is best known to evolutionary anthropologists for his
work with eminent geneticist LL Cavalli-Sforza in developing
formal models of cultural evolution. Their 1981 book Cultural
Transmission and Evolution: A Quantitative Approach and subsequent work remains pivotal to the debate regarding
the nature of cultural evolution.

More recently, Feldman collaborated with biologists John Odling-Smee and Kevin Laland to develop niche
construction theory, formalizing the notion that the built-environment is a dynamic player in the evolutionary
process–spurring novel research into, among other things, the influence of human physical and institutional
structures on cultural inheritance patterns. For example, sociocultural anthropologist Melissa J Brown (U
Minnesota) has worked with Feldman to apply this theory to understanding the dynamic relationships between
social hierarchies and social roles in Chinese society, and cultural practices such as footbinding and uxorilocal
marriage.

In a model project for demonstrating the importance of evolutionary thinking to solving real world human
problems, Feldman and colleagues have been exploring the consequences of the unbalanced sex ratio at birth in
China for the last two decades. Their work first demonstrated that the current trend would lead to some 1-million more men than women of marriageable age each year beginning in 2010. Using empirical field research on the transmission of cultural values regarding son preference and marriage practices, he and his collaborators
here and in China developed public policy options to help shift community preferences. Stanford biologist Shripad Tuljapurkar, a collaborator on the project since its inception underlines the importance of this work:

> Findings from that program of research have had substantial influence on Chinese policy initiatives...aimed at
reducing sex bias at birth. Marc has also made a lasting contribution to Population Research at Xi’an Jiaotong
[University] in particular and more broadly in China, since many scientists from that program...have trained
with Marc at Stanford over these years.

One of those scientists, demographer and current director of the Population Research Institute at Xi’an Jiaotong,
Li Shuzhuo, says the findings of this research have been well received by policy makers in China. Based on their
research, the Chinese government instituted the national “Care for Girls” program in 2006 to improve the survivorship of girls.

“In short,” writes Li, “Marc’s work has made a tremendous contribution in China to better understanding how
culture can be mathematically and quantitatively studied, [and] how basic scientific and anthropological research
can be applied to develop public policies to address existing social and cultural problems.”

Such middle-ground research, between rigorous quantitative reasoning and humanist applications to better
human affairs, is relatively rare, Brown believes, “let alone the more fraught goal of considering the nexus of
social, cultural, and genetic influences on humans.” However, she notes, “Marc’s own research works precisely at
this fraught nexus, where he has continued to remind us all of the potential power of ideas and social learning in
interaction with genetic and ecological influences, and promote further work at this nexus.” Brown thinks that
behind his research has always been a concern for ethics. Indeed, she notes that his modeling of cultural evolution
arose out of a concern he and Cavalli-Sforza shared about claims that variations in IQ scores were genetically-
based. They demonstrated genes need not be invoked to explain the variation, but that cultural transmission
could explain it entirely.

Most critically, Feldman’s challenge to these racist ideas was thoroughly scientific. As Jones explains, “[l]ots of
people don’t like the ideas...but Marc (and [Richard] Lewontin) showed the profound methodological weaknesses
of the studies on which debates over race, heritability, and IQ are based.” Feldman’s participation in the Human
Genome Project is a more recent example of his drive to hold genetics researchers accountable to those concerned
over potential abuses of the information that would be produced. While generating huge controversy, Brown
reports that cross-disciplinary conversations at Stanford “brought to light the ethically-driven efforts of Marc and
others to bring more diversity to the community of genetic scholars...” Brown hopes election to the NAS will
make his ethical efforts more visible to the academy and the public.

For those close to him, Feldman is held not only in the highest regard as a scientist but also as a friend and
colleague. Jones remarks that “[he] cares deeply for his people and goes to bat for them in order to help them
succeed. Marc has been a great mentor to me...I’ve been very grateful to have him in my camp!” Tuljapurkar feels
similarly stating, “Marc has been and is a valued friend, supporter, mentor and colleague to me and to a wide
circle of the best scientists working on evolution and population today. His manifold contributions have long
been due the recognition of election to the NAS.”

Congratulations to Marcus Feldman for receiving the prestigious honor of election to the NAS. Colleagues and
friends agree it is well-deserved.
