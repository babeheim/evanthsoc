In August, the EAS held a special election to fill three positions: two board members at-large and president-elect.
I am pleased to announce that Peter Richerson has been elected our new EAS president-elect, and our new
members at-large are Karen L Kramer and Jeffrey Winking. They will take office during the annual AAA
meeting this month.

Peter Richerson is an emeritus professor in the Department of Environmental Science and Policy at UC Davis.
He has been a member since the inception of the society and is a key figure in the development of dual-
inheritance, or gene-culture co-evolutionary, perspectives on the evolution of human behavior. He is currently
working on a project to develop practical applications of cultural evolutionary theory in the area of organizational
management. This project is funded by the Collins Family Foundation. Richerson served as the president of the
Evolution and Human Behavior Society between 2009-11. The EAS president-elect serves two years as president-
elect and two years as president

Jeffrey Winking is an assistant professor of anthropology at Texas A&M. Winking has been an EAS member for
six years. His research focuses on family formation, parental care and prosociality. As a member of the board, he
looks forward to working to promote the growth of our membership, our graduate support and our presence at
the annual meeting. Karen L Kramer is an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Utah. Her
research interests include comparative life history, demography and ethnography. Board members at-large serve
four-year terms.

In addition to the changing of the board, the 2013 annual meeting will again be host to a strong series of EAS
