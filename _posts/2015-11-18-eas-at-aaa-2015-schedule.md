Following the departure of co­editors Siobhan Mattison and Adam Boyette, we (Katie Starkweather and Melanie Martin) will be picking up the reigns and serving as co­editors for the next few years. In today’s column, we will take a moment to briefly introduce ourselves, then highlight EAS events and other sessions of interest from the upcoming AAA meetings in Denver, November 18­22, 2015.

KS – Hi all. I’m Katie Starkweather, a senior PhD student from the U of Missouri’s Department of Anthropology. I am a human behavioral ecologist who researches marriage, parental investment, and household economics among the Shodagor, a semi­nomadic, boat­dwelling subculture in Bangladesh.

I have just finished serving as the Student Representative for EAS and am excited to move into this new role as one of the co­editors for the newsletter. I look forward to cover topics in this newsletter that are important to the members of our society, such as: recent research that relates to EAS, advice on different aspects of being an academic (i.e. where to get training in different methods), applications of evolutionary anthropology, and interviews with evolutionary anthropologists.

MM – Hi there. I’m Melanie Martin. I just completed my PhD in Integrative Anthropological Sciences at the U of California Santa Barbara, and in January begin a postdoctoral appointment at the Yale U Department of Anthropology. My research with the Tsimane of Bolivia and the Toba of Argentina examines maternal­offspring conflict and ecological factors shaping life history transitions, growth and development, infant feeding practices, maternal reproductive outcomes, and human microbiomes.

As incoming co­editor of the EAS newsletter, I am excited to shine a light on interdisciplinary research contributed by our members, in particular work with broader policy implications for public health, education, economics, human rights, or international affairs.
