Hi Evolutionary Anthropology Society (EAS) members!

Back by popular demand is a list by day of EAS sessions and a list of non­EAS sessions and other events of possible interest (sorry if we have overlooked a group or talk of interest). Workshops and special events (including crashable receptions) are italicized. Events are listed by day, time and session or event title. EAS sessions are bolded and room numbers and links are included for these. We’re looking forward to seeing you all in Minneapolis!
