# Report from the Presidents

Hello EAS Members,

The school year is winding down, but the field season is just beginning. Here are a few updates and announcements to get you up to date with what’s happening at the Evolutionary Anthropology Society.
 
## EAS Elections

It’s time to vote for your next set of EAS representatives. AAA elections are currently open but close on May 31st. Just go to americananthro.org and click on the red voting box icon on the right for instructions. **Don’t forget to vote!**
 
## AAA Annual Meeting

The EAS Program Committee has been hard at work organizing the EAS sessions for this fall’s AAA meetings.  Thanks to all of you who submitted sessions or abstracts—the program is shaping up to be one of the largest we have ever had, with some terrific talks and roundtables. Stay tuned for more details later in the summer!

## Membership

EAS membership now stands at about 180, rather below the 225 that the AAA considers healthy. Falling membership is an AAA wide issue, however. We created a list of about 1,000 people who have belonged to the EAS over the last decade, and wrote them encouraging them to rejoin. Please consider encouraging your students and colleagues to join as well.

## Web Site

Bret Beheim is our new Web Master and will have a snazzy new website up and running shortly.

Pete Richerson, President

Mary Shenk, President-Elect

Ray Hames, Past President
