## 2018 AAA Meetings—Call for Abstracts and Session Proposals

It's time to begin thinking about our next EAS meeting at the AAA's, which will be held this year in San Jose, California. The theme for this year's meeting is "Change in the Anthropological Imagination".

We are scheduled to receive guaranteed slots for two invited paper sessions and one poster session. In the recent past we have also been able to sponsor two to three volunteered sessions composed of individual abstracts the program committee organized into sessions or from session proposals. We depend upon members both to craft proposals for these sessions and to volunteer to make presentations and posters. Last year’s sessions had excellent contributions and were well attended. Please help us make this year’s sessions equally exciting!

The AAA deadline this year for the submission of both Invited and Volunteered sessions as well as individual paper and poster presentations at the Annual Meeting in San Jose is **April 15th**. Those of you who are planning to submit a session proposal or contribute a paper should send it to [Brooke](mailto:bscelza@gmail.com) (Chair of the 2018 EAS Program Committee) by **March 15th**. This will allow us to get a head start on the process and ensure that we can maximize everyone’s opportunity to make a presentation.

If you are submitting a session proposal, please submit a session abstract of no more than 500 words, keywords, length of session (normally 105 minutes for 6-7 papers), anticipated attendance, presenter names and roles. You should also include as many of the paper abstracts as you can.

If you are submitting a paper abstract, please submit a title and 250 word abstract along with a few key words.

After our review, all sessions, volunteered papers, and poster proposals must be officially submitted by organizers and presenters through the official AAA portal by **Monday, April 16th at 3 pm EDT (no new submissions may be started after 2 pm EDT)**. The official call for papers can be found [here](http://www.aaanet.org/meetings/Call-for-Papers.cfm).

Thanks,
The EAS Program Committee: Brooke Scelza, Mary Shenk, Chris von Rueden & Sarah Alami
