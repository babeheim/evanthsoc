We’d like to bring to your attention to some upcoming opportunities to publish in Anthropology News as part of EAS Section News — see details from our Section News Editors below!

We’d also like to remind you that abstract submission for the [2018 AAA Annual Meeting](http://amaa.informz.net/z/cjUucD9taT0yMzExODYyJnA9MSZ1PTM3NDA4ODk5MyZsaT0xNDAwMjk1Mw/index.html) in San Jose is now open for internal review by EAS. Please send your session and/or individual abstracts to [Brooke Scelza](bscelza@gmail.com) (Program Chair) by March 15th. We have copied in the original call for abstracts below.

# Spotlight July/August 2018 Anthropology News Print Edition

We are looking for a guest-authored article to feature in the upcoming special Section News print edition. In 2017, *Anthropology News* switched to a primarily online format, supplemented with only four glossy print editions per year. The July/August edition is dedicated to highlighting Section News.

This year’s issue theme is “Anthropology Futures.” We are particularly interested in a post touching on some aspect of the future of Evolutionary Anthropology, or highlighting evolutionary-grounded and future-oriented research on human behavior, landscapes, conflict, technology, etc.

Email [Melanie Martin](melaamartin@gmail.com) or [Katie Starkweather](kstarkweather8@gmail.com) if interested. The article should be 1200 words or less, and written for a general audience. For an example, see last year’s special edition column by Pete Richerson and Raymond Hames, *Busting Myths about Evolutionary Anthropology*.

A first draft is due **March 23rd**. Contact us ASAP with your idea!
 
# Rolling EAS Section News Blog Posts

Do you want to highlight your research for a broader audience? Practice popular science writing? Write an opinion piece from an evolutionary perspective? Then write a guest blog post for EAS section news! Blog posts are published online at Anthropology News on a rolling basis.

Blog posts should be less than 1,000 words and written to maximize online readership by using hyperlinks, images, and limited jargon. Contact Melanie or Katie with your idea and we will work with you on the submission.

# REMINDER: 2018 AAA Annual Meeting—Call for Abstracts and Session Proposals

It's time to begin thinking about our next EAS meeting at the [AAA Annual Meeting](http://amaa.informz.net/z/cjUucD9taT0yMzExODYyJnA9MSZ1PTM3NDA4ODk5MyZsaT0xNDAwMjk1Mw/index.html), which will be held this year in San Jose, California. The theme for this year's meeting is 'Change in the Anthropological Imagination.'

We are scheduled to receive guaranteed slots for two invited paper sessions and one poster session. In the recent past we have also been able to sponsor two to three volunteered sessions composed of individual abstracts the program committee organized into sessions or from session proposals. We depend upon members to craft proposals for these sessions and to volunteer to make presentations and posters. Last year’s sessions had excellent contributions and were well attended. Please help us make this year’s sessions equally exciting!

The AAA deadline this year for the submission of both invited and volunteered sessions as well as individual paper and poster presentations at the Annual Meeting in San Jose is April 15th. Those of you who are planning to submit a session proposal or contribute a paper should send it to [Brooke](bscelza@gmail.com) (Chair of the 2018 EAS Program Committee) by March 15th. This will allow us to get a head start on the process and ensure that we can maximize everyone’s opportunity to make a presentation.

If you are submitting a paper abstract, please submit a title and 250 word abstract along with a few key words.
 
If you are submitting a session proposal, please submit a session abstract of no more than 500 words, keywords, length of session (normally 105 minutes for 6-7 papers), anticipated attendance, presenter names and roles. You should also include as many of the paper abstracts as you can.
 
After our review, all sessions, volunteered papers, and poster proposals must be officially submitted by organizers and presenters through the official AAA portal by Monday, **April 16th at 3 pm EDT** (no new submissions may be started after 2 pm EDT). The official [call for papers](http://amaa.informz.net/z/cjUucD9taT0yMzExODYyJnA9MSZ1PTM3NDA4ODk5MyZsaT0xNDAwMjk1NA/index.html) can be found here.
