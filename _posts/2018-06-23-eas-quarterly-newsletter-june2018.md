# Report from the Presidents
 
Evolutionary Anthropology Society Members,
 
We hope you’re enjoying the end of the school year and the start of summer. We’ve been hard at work getting ready for this fall’s AAA meetings in San Jose. It’s shaping up to be a great meeting for EAS with three sessions already confirmed. And, with conference scheduling having just begun, more great sessions will be on their way soon!  Here’s what we have in store so far:

- ***“Open Science and the Anthropological Imagination— Resilience and Adaptation amidst a Global Crisis in Replication and Scientific Practice”*** has been accepted as an Executive Session by the AAA program committee. Organized by Mary Shenk & Jeremy Koster, the session will feature flash presentations and discussion by Bret Beheim, H. Russell Bernard, Daniel Hruschka, Jeremy Koster, Melanie Martin, Lisa McAllister, Elspeth Ready, Pete Richerson, Paul Smaldino, Leonid Tiokhin, and Deborah Winslow.

- ***“Ages and Stages: Child learning, exploration, and helping behaviors in foraging and transitioning populations”*** has been accepted as an Invited Session by EAS. The session includes talks and discussion by Helen Davis, Alyssa Crittenden, Elizabeth Cashdan, Sheina Lew-Levy, Michelle Scalise Sugiyama, Karen Kramer, and Larry Sugiyama.

- ***“Updating our Understanding of Economic Games: innovations, complications and interpretations”*** has been accepted as an Invited Session by EAS. The session includes talks and discussion by Curtis Atkisson, Cristina Moya, Nicole Naar, Jeff Andrews, and Monique Borgerhoff Mulder.

Enjoy your summer—and get in touch if you have things you’d like to share!  We’ll be back in September with some more annual meeting updates and other announcements of interest.
