# Report from the Presidents

Dear EAS Members,

As the semester winds down, we celebrate another exciting year at EAS, including a terrific conference in San Jose. In the coming year we will have a lot of big decisions to make—including important debates about the future home of EAS. We have begun meeting with the leadership at other organizations and will continue with those into the summer. Please be sure to join us in Vancouver to be part of the next round of these discussions.
