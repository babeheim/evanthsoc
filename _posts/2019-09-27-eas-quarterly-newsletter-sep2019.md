# Report from the Presidents

Dear EAS Members,

Welcome back for fall 2019!

We’d like to start by announcing the winners of the EAS Election: *Karen Kramer* of the University of Utah is our incoming President Elect. *Alyssa Crittenden* of UNLV and Jeremy Koster of the University of Cincinnati are our incoming Executive Board Members. *Drew Gerkey* of Oregon State University is our incoming Treasurer.  *Adam Reynolds* of the University of New Mexico is our incoming Student Representative.  Congratulations to all of our incoming officers, and many thanks to those who were willing to run for office!

As you all know, in the coming year we have a big decision to make about the future home of EAS. We have been meeting with the leadership of other organizations, and in October we expect to circulate information on these discussions to the EAS membership. This topic will be the focus of the EAS business meeting at the annual AAA meetings in Vancouver prior to a vote of the membership later this year. 

We’re all looking forward to a great schedule of talks at the AAA meetings in Vancouver this October.  The complete EAS schedule—along with a few relevant sessions sponsored by other sections—is listed below.  We look forward to seeing many of you in Vancouver!

The Oklahoma Center for Evolutionary Analysis is recruiting PhD students: Multiple funded PhD positions for incoming [graduate students](https://evanthsoc.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b66d0effc60d7e0f8e9508bd8&id=6407ccb598&e=873ff7a1dd) in Experimental Psychology at Oklahoma State University.

A group of graduate students from WSU and Emory are brainstorming a late-breaking roundtable submission for the 2019 AAAs on the topic of reproductive rights as human rights with a focus on abortion in light of recent anti-abortion legislation passed in 6 U.S. states. They are looking for 1-2 other biocultural/evolutionary/medical anthropologists to participate. Discussion points will include evolutionary and biocultural perspectives on reproductive rights and the role of anthropology in activism. Please email klsyme@gmail.com if you're interested in participating.

Emory University’s Department of Anthropology is hiring three biological anthropologists. More information can be found [here](https://evanthsoc.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b66d0effc60d7e0f8e9508bd8&id=ffe1dddaae&e=873ff7a1dd). 

The Culture, Behavior, Evolution and Development Lab (CuBED) in the Department of Psychology at Simon Fraser University is looking to recruit MA/PhD students.

Funding requires the student to work on the SSHRD IDG-funded project. The student is expected to apply for additional fellowship funding to cover their fees, and/or work as a TA for additional funding through the completion of their degree.The graduate student will be based in the Department of Psychology and will be supervised by Dr. Michelle Kline. Please contact Dr. Kline (makline@sfu.ca) directly for interest in applying. Applicants must apply to the departmental program (Portal open: October 15 – December 1, 2019) in addition to discussing their application with Dr. Kline.
