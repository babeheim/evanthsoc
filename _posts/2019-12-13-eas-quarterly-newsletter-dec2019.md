# Report from the Presidents

Dear EAS Members,

We hope that you all enjoyed the AAA/CAA meeting in Vancouver as much as we did. We had another round of stimulating EAS sessions and an exciting business meeting (secret votes!) discussing the future of EAS (more on that below).

We’d like to start by announcing the winners of the EAS New Investigator and Student awards at the conference. Co-winners for the student award were Adam Reynolds (University of New Mexico) and Curtis Atkisson (UC Davis), and co-winners for the New Investigator prize were Katie Starkweather (University of New Mexico) and Melanie Martin (University of Washington). Congratulations!

Our new board is now in place with Karen Kramer beginning her role as President-Elect, Alyssa Crittenden and Jeremy Koster joining as members-at-large, and Adam Reynolds as the new student rep. We have also appointed Drew Gerkey to serve as Treasurer, taking over for Dawn Neill. Thanks to Dawn for her many years of service. Newsletter editors Melanie Martin and Katie Starkweather are also stepping down and we are looking for some interested parties to take over. This is a great chance for one or two senior graduate students or early-career people to take on a more active role in EAS. If you are interested or would like more information, please contact us.

Finally, the focus of our board and business meetings this year was once again on the future of EAS. Following a series of meetings that Mary and Brooke had with presidents and other representatives at AAPA, HBA, HBES and AAA, we presented a slate of options to the board for discussion. Upon careful consideration, the board proposed a hybrid model that would allow us to pilot a move to either AAPA (soon AABA) or HBA, while still maintaining our presence at AAA until a final decision is made. At the business meeting, straw polls were held that endorsed this hybrid model and pointed to AAPA as the primary organization to work with on piloting a move. We will now move forward with setting this plan into action, with more details forthcoming over the next year. Here are the first two things to keep on your radar, however: First, EAS will be meeting as usual at the AAA meetings in St. Louis in November 2020, so get ready to submit your abstracts and session proposals in March/April. Second, in an effort to kick off this new era in EAS’s history we will be hosting an informal event for current and potential future EAS members at the AAPA/HBA meetings in Los Angeles in April 2020, so stay tuned for details in upcoming newsletters.

Sincerely,

Brooke Scelza (President)
Karen Kramer (President-Elect)
