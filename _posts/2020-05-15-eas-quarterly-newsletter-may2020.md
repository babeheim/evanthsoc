# Report from the Presidents

Dear EAS Members,
 
We hope that you are all managing to find some peace and balance in these challenging times. So much has changed since our last newsletter in February.
 
The EAS board has met several times to discuss ways that we can respond as a society to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last month you should have received an email that EAS signed on to, in conjunction with the Cultural Evolution Society (CES) and the European Human Behavior and Evolution Association (EHBEA). In that email we called for our members to think about ways that they could engage with the communities they work with, in conjunction with local and national entities where possible, to pass on information about the pandemic and how to prevent transmission of the disease. We appreciate that our members may be variably comfortable with taking on such work. Some may have pre-established relationships with public health organizations or government ministries and can work through them. Others of us may not have these collaborations in place, but might use this situation as an opportunity to think about building such links. We are not advocating any particular strategy, just encouraging our members to think about these issues as they pertain to the communities they work with.
 
A second focus of our meetings was to discuss the ways in which COVID-related restrictions are impacting our research and scholarship, particularly for students, post-docs and junior scholars who may have been displaced from pursuing or continuing their field work, or  do not have long-term datasets to draw upon to continue their research. In order to think about ways to lessen the impact of these disruptions, we are planning a Zoom meeting for interested parties to share suggestions and strategize ways that we as a society can help to bring parties together and facilitate collaborative relationships. Therefore, we encourage both junior and senior colleagues to attend. If you are interested, please RSVP to me (Brooke) by responding to this email and we will send you a link to the Zoom meeting (planned for sometime in late May).
 
Finally, we discussed how conference cancellations have impacted our plans for the future of EAS. Our previous plan was to have an EAS sponsored event at the AAPA meetings in Los Angeles last month. The goal of this gathering was to bring together current EAS members who attend HBA/AAPA and to draw in potential new members and hear their thoughts (informally) about EAS joining them. Given the cancellation of AAPA, our next opportunity to get together as a group will be at the AAA meetings in St. Louis. We had a number of exciting talks submitted and look forward to a full slate of EAS sessions this year. Between now and then, we will continue to reach out to officers at AAPA to gain a fuller understanding of what an EAS/AAPA hybrid could look like and will report on these meetings at our business meeting in the fall.
 
Speaking of AAA, if you have not yet submitted your abstract, the deadline to do so has been extended to May 15th. If you did not submit an abstract to EAS you can still submit your abstract directly to AAA and mark EAS as the section you would like to review it. We encourage you to submit abstracts in the next two weeks, and we look forward to seeing you all in St. Louis (hopefully in person!).
 
Sincerely,
 
Brooke Scelza (President)

Karen Kramer (President-Elect)

Mary Shenk (Past President)
