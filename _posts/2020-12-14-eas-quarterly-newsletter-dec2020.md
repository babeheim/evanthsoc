## Report from the Presidents

Greetings EAS Members,

Normally, our December newsletter would contain a summary of our recent annual meeting, but as you know, this year is not at all like other years. While the AAA did hold a virtual meeting (and I hope some of you were able to attend) EAS did not have sessions. We did, however, hold virtual board and business meetings where we discussed the future of the society, ways to stay connected during COVID, and strategies for improving our membership numbers and engaging more meaningfully with students.
 
The plan discussed at our meetings was to continue to enact the mandate that was set for us in previous discussions and votes: to set up plans to begin a potential transition from AAA to the AAPA (soon to be AABA). To that end, President-elect Karen Kramer and I will be setting up meeting with the AAPA leadership in the new year to discuss specifics. If there is an in-person meeting in Baltimore we may also try to organize a joint AAPA/EAS event. Stay tuned for details.
 
Although we were unable to hold EAS sessions this year, we want to continue the tradition of awarding students and new investigators who are doing innovative and exciting work within the evolutionary social sciences. To that end, we will be holding a paper competition for students (in MA or PhD programs) and new investigators (those within 5 years of completing the PhD). Submissions should be sent to bscelza@gmail.com by February 15, 2021. An official call for papers will go out on social media and to our listserv shortly. An EAS awards committee will read and judge the papers, and winners will be announced in the spring newsletter and on our website.
 
We are also working to increase our presence on social media. If you don’t already follow our Twitter (@evanthsociety ) and Facebook groups, please do. We are working to retweet as many EAS papers and announcements as possible.
 
Finally, we are looking for someone to take over for the wonderful Delaney Glass as newsletter editor for EAS. Typically this post is filled by a student, who works closely with the President, President-Elect and Past-President to get out our quarterly newsletters to members. If you are interested, please email me at bscelza@gmail.com with a short statement about your interest.
 
I’m sure we are all more than ready to say goodbye to 2020. On that note, see you in 2021!
 
Brooke Scelza, EAS President
Karen Kramer, EAS President-Elect
Mary Shenk, EAS Past-President
