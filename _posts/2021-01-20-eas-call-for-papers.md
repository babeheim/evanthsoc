The Evolutionary Anthropology Society is soliciting submissions for their annual awards for Best Student and Best New Investigator. Due to the cancellation of in-person sessions at the 2020 AAA Annual Meeting, EAS has decided to base their awards on paper submissions, in lieu of our typical process of awarding presentations at the meeting. Papers do not have to be based on proposed talks for the 2020 meeting, but should be current work that has not been presented at previous AAA meetings and is currently unpublished. Winners in both categories will have the <u>option</u> to publish their paper at *Human Nature* (pending peer review) through a special submission process, if their submission has not already been published elsewhere.

Submissions should be sent to [bscelza@gmail.com](mailto:bscelza@gmail.com) by March 15, 2021. An EAS awards committee will review submissions and winners will be announced in April of 2021. 
 
**Eligibility:** Papers may be submitted by individuals who held an EAS membership in either 2019-2020 or 2020-2021.
- *Student Award:* individuals who are currently enrolled in either a Masters or PhD program
- *New Investigator Award:* individuals who received their PhD in the last 5 years 

**Submission Details:** The person submitting should be the first author of their paper, and that paper should be currently unpublished. Papers must be no more than 10,000 words (excluding references) with an abstract of 200 words. If you are planning to submit your paper to Human Nature if it wins, please follow the formatting requirements on their website.
Please submit your paper in one of the following formats (.doc, .pdf) to [bscelza@gmail.com](mailto:bscelza@gmail.com) by 11:59pm on March 15, 2021. Please put “EAS Paper Competition” in the subject line of your email.
